 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a website that teaches Italian culture. The website should include different routes for different topics, such as history, food, and language. The website should also be responsive, so that it can be viewed on different devices.

## Design

The design for the website will be a Flask application. Flask is a Python microframework that is well-suited for building websites. The website will have the following routes:

* Home page: This route will display the home page of the website. The home page will include a brief introduction to Italian culture, as well as links to the other routes.
* History page: This route will display a history of Italy. The history page will include information on the different periods of Italian history, such as the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and the modern era.
* Food page: This route will display information on Italian food. The food page will include information on the different types of Italian food, as well as recipes for some popular Italian dishes.
* Language page: This route will display information on the Italian language. The language page will include information on the grammar and pronunciation of Italian, as well as some common Italian phrases.

The website will be responsive, so that it can be viewed on different devices. The website will use a Bootstrap framework to make it responsive. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that is used to create responsive websites.

* `index.html`: This file will be the home page of the website.

* `food.html`: This file will display information on Italian food.
* `language.html`: This file will display information on the Italian language.
* `base.html`: This file will be the base template for all of the other HTML files.
